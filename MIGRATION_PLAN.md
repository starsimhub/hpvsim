# HPVsim v3.0 Migration Plan

## Overview

HPVsim v3.0 is a reimplementation of HPVsim on the [Starsim](https://starsim.org/) agent-based modeling framework. The original HPVsim (v2.x, ~16,000 LOC) uses a fully custom architecture. v3.0 inherits from Starsim's core classes (`ss.Sim`, `ss.Disease`, `ss.Network`, `ss.Intervention`, `ss.Analyzer`, `ss.Connector`) while keeping HPVsim's domain-specific logic: HPV natural history, genotype dynamics, cross-immunity, cervical cancer progression.

Migration work happens on the `v3.0-dev` branch (created off `rc2.3`). v3.0 is considered **done** when the analysis-repo suite that validated v2.3 (issues #64, #68–#73, #82–#87) reproduces on v3 with overlapping uncertainty intervals on headline results, and the migration guide is published.

## Validation criteria

Validation does **not** require identical numerical output. Results are considered equivalent when uncertainty intervals overlap across multiple seeds on headline results of the v2 analysis-repo suite. The goal is epidemiologically equivalent behavior, not bit-for-bit reproducibility.

Canonical validation set: the analysis repos defined in issue [#64](https://github.com/starsimhub/hpvsim/issues/64) and validated against v2.3 under issues #68–#73 and #82–#87:

- `hpvsim_methods_manuscript`
- `hpvsim_india`
- `hpvsim_rwanda`
- `hpvsim_1dose`
- `hpvsim_pxv_younger`
- `hpv_faster_kenya`
